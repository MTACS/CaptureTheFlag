# CaptureTheFlag

PLEASE DO NOT USE THE INCLUDED STRING FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES

I'm sure there are errors in the code, I just made it quick, feel free to make pull requests to improve it. A reboot or ldrestart might help the effectiveness of CaptureTheFlag.

As of 1.0.4, CaptureTheFlag uses a better method to replace bad strings, thanks to [PoomSmart](https://github.com/PoomSmart)
